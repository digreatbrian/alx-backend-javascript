## This readme provides exercises to learn unit testing in Node.js.

### Key topics covered:
 * Mocha: Using Mocha to create test suites.
 * Assertion libraries: Using assert and chai for assertions.
 * Test structure: Organizing tests with descriptions and suites.
 * Spies and stubs: Understanding and using spies and stubs for testing.
 * Hooks: Using beforeEach and afterEach hooks to set up and tear down tests.
 * Asynchronous testing: Handling asynchronous operations in tests.
 * Integration testing: Writing tests for entire applications.
Tasks include:
 * Creating basic tests with Mocha and assert.
 * Combining descriptions for better test organization.
 * Using chai for BDD-style tests.
 * Using spies and stubs to test function interactions.
 * Using hooks to set up and tear down tests.
 * Handling asynchronous tests.
 * Writing integration tests for a small Node server.
